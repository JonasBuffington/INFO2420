        <h2>Utah National Parks</h2>
        <a href="https://www.utah.com/destinations/national-parks">www.utah.com/destinations/national-parks</a>
        <h2>Q/A:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: What was your first impression of this site?<br>
            A: It seems organized and professional.</li>
            <li>Q: How does this site organize the flow of information?<br>
            A: All of the links are on the left side which helps for organization and easy navigability of the site.<br>
            in the center is larger buttons that take you to the same place as the links, they have nice images of the parks. </li>
            <li>Q: Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?<br>
            A: It makes sense. Every element seems well placed and thought out, everything has a reason to be where it is.</li>
            <li>Q: Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?<br>
            A: I think it definitely enhances the site. It adds good visual flair which would not be present if the site did not have graphics.</li>
            <li>Q: How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?<br>
            A: The load time of most of the elements was good, but the images loaded quite slowly, which I'm sure could be improved.</li>
            <li>Q: Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?<br>
            A: The elements are very readable and normal. No visual elements on the site strike me as ugly or detract from the site.</li>
            <li>Q: Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?<br>
            A: The site has a good navigation bar, it seems to contain links to necessary information.</li>
            <li>Q: Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?<br>
            A: Yes, the color scheme and style are consistent across all the pages, and it feels appropriate and well put together.</li>
            <li>Q: How does the site respond to smaller window sizes?<br>
            A: The site responds well to smaller window sizes, it keeps every element visible and readable.</li>
            <li>Q: What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?<br>
            A: I think something this site did well was making all of the information that people are most likely to be looking for very accesible.<br>
            The main page immediately presents information that I believe most people who are accessing the site would want to see first.</li>
        </ul>
